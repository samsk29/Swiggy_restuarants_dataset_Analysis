# Swiggy_restuarants_dataset_Analysis
Hello,

Thrilled to share that I've successfully completed a fascinating project using Power BI, where I dived deep into Swiggy's restaurant dataset. In this project I analyzed various dimensions including city-specific dynamics, median pricing, delivery times, and the ever-critical median ratings.

In conclusion,our analysis of Swiggy's performance underscores a few important findings. A solid average rating of 4 reflects satisfied customers across cities. Kolkata emerges as a hotspot with the highest restaurant count and a surprising number of other cities ordering through it. The consistent average price range of 350 to 370 emphasizes Swiggy's ability to offer both value and quality. These insights showcase Swiggy's effective presence, particularly in Kolkata, and its knack for maintaining a reasonable yet rewarding food experience.

Here's my project where you can explore the visualizations and findings firsthand!
